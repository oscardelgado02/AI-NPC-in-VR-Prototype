### API Usage in Scripts

The package includes a `HuggingFaceAPI` class that you can use from your scripts.

2. Call the API method for the task you want.
```
using HuggingFace.API;

HuggingFaceAPI.TextToImage("a cat in a hat", result => {
    // Do something with the result, which in this case is a Texture2D
}, error => {
    // Handle errors
    Debug.LogError(error);
});
```

For a more advanced scripting example, refer to the included example scripts.
